# Conway-Game-of-Life
*Conway's game of life programmed in Java.*

This is my first real Java project, so bear with me if the code is not the best! 

Wondering what Conway's game of life is? Check this link https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life

I aim to have this finished in a week, but I'm not sure

Also, I may switch to Python and possible Pygame if I find it too difficult in Java!
